# Student_Attendance_Portal


The Student Attendance Portal is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manage student attendance. The application allows users to add classes, add students to classes, and mark student attendance as present, absent, or leave. Users can also view attendance records.

The application uses frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and does not use a backend or database. All data is stored locally in the browser and will be lost when the browser is closed.

To use the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. From there, you can add classes, add students, and mark attendance. You can also view attendance records by clicking the "View Attendance" button.

Please note that the application has some limitations. There is no data validation or error handling implemented, and all data is stored locally in the browser. Additionally, there is no user authentication or authorization implemented.

Future enhancements to the application could include implementing add or remove the student and edit their names,  data validation and error handling, using a backend database to store data persistently, and implementing user authentication and authorization. Additional features could also be added to view attendance reports and analytics.
